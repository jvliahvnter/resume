<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The year was 1999-ish. I was just a kid. But I was making websites. I was using HTML3 and learning from a website called <a href="http://www.lissaexplains.com/">Lissa Explains it All</a>. She also explained CSS, javascript, and some java. Yes, she really did explain it all. But this story isn't about her. This story is about me. After years of practicing front end web development in my spare time as a kid, I decided to grow up and focus on learning skills that could "actually" get me a job. Hardy har.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the year in which you are reading this. I'm a web developer again. That's pretty much all you need to know, but if you're interested in a semi-detailed timeline in bullet point form, I guess you can read the stuff below.</p>
